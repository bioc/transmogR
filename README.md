This package contains functions for creating a variant-modified, or mogrified, 
reference genome or transcriptome.
SNPs, Insertions and Deletions are all supported.

With a generous tip of the hat and deep appreciation to Bill Watterson. 
The inspiration for many function names can be found [here](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1988/02/14).
Results are expected to be more predictable than for prototype transmogrifiers.
